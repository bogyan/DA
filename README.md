This is a project we did with my teammates on the Duration Analysis subject. In the analysis, parametric, non-parametric, and semi-parametric models were used, both classical and Bayesian approaches. Ultimately, the information-theoretic model within the Bayesian approach proved to be more effective than the non-informative model.
